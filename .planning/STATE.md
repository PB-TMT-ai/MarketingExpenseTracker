# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-04)

**Core value:** Spend stays inside the plan, and execution progress is always visible — only planned SFIDs can receive actuals, and "% of plan executed" is the headline metric.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-04 — Roadmap created (5 phases, coarse granularity), 30/30 requirements mapped

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Dependency-driven 5-phase order — Foundation → Plan Upload → Grid → Compliance/Dashboard → Export. The hardest-to-retrofit guarantees (off-plan FK, UNIQUE match key, numeric money, version column, RESTRICT, pooled Neon connection) all land in Phase 1.
- [Roadmap]: Confirmed — executions are many-per-plan-row (multi-unit per SFID, e.g. multiple walls); plans carry a planned-cost/budget column (enables budget-vs-actual on the dashboard).

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

Open questions to resolve in the relevant phase's discuss step (NOT blockers for planning):
- [Phase 1] Plan-row grain for multi-unit activities — multi-unit is confirmed YES; the UNIQUE match key and whether executions are unique per plan row must reflect this before migrations lock.
- [Phase 2] Non-destructive re-upload semantics (append/upsert/replace; policy for a removed plan row that already has actuals).
- [Phase 4] Exact completeness math for partial / in-progress actuals.
- [Phase 1] Budget/planned-cost column confirmed PRESENT — model as numeric on plan rows.
